## 3. Basic Usage
**NOTE:** configUSE_TRACE_FACILITY and configGENERATE_RUN_TIME_STATS must be defined as **1** in FreeRTOSConfig.h for this API function task_monitor() to be available.
```C
// 1. Include header:
#include "task_monitor.h"

void app_main(void)
{
    // 2. Start task monitor:
    task_monitor();
}
```
## 4. Getting Started
To get started with the ESP32 Task Monitor project, you'll need an ESP32 microcontroller and a host computer running Python. You'll also need to install the ESP-IDF development framework and the required Python packages.

### 4.1 Clone the project repository:
```C
    git clone https://github.com/VPavlusha/ESP32_Task_Monitor.git
```
### 4.2 Build the project:
```C
    cd ESP32_Task_Monitor
    idf.py build
```
### 4.3 Flash onto your ESP32 microcontroller:
```C
    idf.py -p PORT [-b BAUD] flash
```
Replace PORT with your ESP32 boardâ€™s serial port name.
You can also change the flasher baud rate by replacing BAUD with the baud rate you need. The default baud rate is 460800.<br/>
### 4.4 Monitor the output:
```C
    idf.py -p <PORT> monitor
```
Do not forget to replace PORT with your serial port name.

More information how to build project: [ESP-IDF Programming Guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/v5.0.1/esp32/get-started/start-project.html).

## 5. Example
This project includes an [example](https://github.com/VPavlusha/ESP32_Task_Monitor/tree/main/main) that showcases the functionality of the Task Monitor library. This example provides a practical demonstration of how to use the Task Monitor API to monitor tasks in your own applications.

## 6. Contributing
